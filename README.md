### Steven Chen 23394608

This project is about the tools we have learned so far in Stat 159 and how the tools are useful in writing a document.

`Goal:` Practice with computational tools, such as bash, markdown, pandoc, git, Make, and text editor. 

`Tools I used`
- Git
- GitHub
- MacVim
- Pandoc
- bash
- Make
- markdown

Details of how each tool is used can be found in paper.html under the paper subdirectory.

To regenerate paper.html, simply run Makefile by running "make" in the project directory.

To remove paper.html, simply run "clean" in the project directory.
