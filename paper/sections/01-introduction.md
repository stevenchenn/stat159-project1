## Introduction

One might ask, what is *reproducibility* and why is it important? Imagine a researcher has spent tens of hours to write a piece of computational tool that was vital to his or her research project. However, the researcher forgets to mark down the steps to obtain the final result. Not only does the researcher now have to restart from scratch and rewrite the whole process, but the researcher also has to remember the correct steps. Having reproducibility in one's research allows same or different researchers to replicate identical findings under the same environment, including computer systems, data input, and parameters. Having the ability to reproduce identical results allows other researchers to expand on the research in a collaborative manner. This paper will go through some tools that will help with collaborative and reproducible research:

- Git
- GitHub
- Markdown
- bash
- Pandoc
- Makefile
