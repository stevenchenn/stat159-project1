This paper will go through many different types of computational tools that help make developing new software or research as well as collaborating much easier and more efficient. The tools that this paper will discuss are Git, GitHub, pandoc, Markdown, Make, and Vim text editor. It will dive into the benefits of using these different types of tools and how to use them to create a reproducible project. After reading, one can easily follow the same steps and achieve reproducible results, and hopefully maintain such practice in the long term for future development and research. Lastly, this paper will conlude with discussions on other software considerations as well as on reproducible computational research.
