Conclusions
-----------

Throughout this paper, I referenced back to the current project to give concrete examples on how these tools are being used to reach reproducibility. Although I worked on this project by myself, and for almost the whole day, I found myself learning about these tools in a deeper level. I can definitely take what I learned from this project to expand onto my other projects for other classes where I have to work with other students. The tools I used in this project includes:

- Git
    - version control system to keep track of changes in my project
- GitHub
    - online git service to store my project and share my work
- Markdown
    - language used to write README and other sections of the final document
- bash
    - command line shell used for interacting with GitHub, saving changes, generating files, etc...
- Pandoc
    - convert Markdown files into HTML
- Makefile
    - automation of the process to generate the HTML file

All these tools are important in maintaining a scalable and reproducible project. They are widely used in the industry and in academia, with bunch of documentations online, which I relied heavily on during this project. Most of these tools are easy to pick up, except for Git which took quite a bit of practice to get it right. 

The easy parts of the project were to generate single Markdown file `paper.md` and HTML file `paper.html` because the commands are short and concise. The challenging part was writing the document itself. Although I understood how the tools were used, but explaining it in a way such that non-experienced users would understand took quite a bit of time. I would save thinking of ways to explain the tools was the most time consuming part of this project. Throughout the project while I was writing the document, I could not figure out why the images were not displaying in my section Markdown files. Later I realized that the path was incorrect since the Markdown files are inside `sections`. However, once I converted it to paper.md, the images showed up fine. In conclusion, having reproducibility will make lives easier in the long run, and learning tools that can help achieve that will allow one to gain good practices in maintaining projects and files.
