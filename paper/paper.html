<p>This paper will go through many different types of computational tools that help make developing new software or research as well as collaborating much easier and more efficient. The tools that this paper will discuss are Git, GitHub, pandoc, Markdown, Make, and Vim text editor. It will dive into the benefits of using these different types of tools and how to use them to create a reproducible project. After reading, one can easily follow the same steps and achieve reproducible results, and hopefully maintain such practice in the long term for future development and research. Lastly, this paper will conlude with discussions on other software considerations as well as on reproducible computational research.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>One might ask, what is <em>reproducibility</em> and why is it important? Imagine a researcher has spent tens of hours to write a piece of computational tool that was vital to his or her research project. However, the researcher forgets to mark down the steps to obtain the final result. Not only does the researcher now have to restart from scratch and rewrite the whole process, but the researcher also has to remember the correct steps. Having reproducibility in one's research allows same or different researchers to replicate identical findings under the same environment, including computer systems, data input, and parameters. Having the ability to reproduce identical results allows other researchers to expand on the research in a collaborative manner. This paper will go through some tools that will help with collaborative and reproducible research:</p>

<p>Git is an open-source version control system that is used for mainly software development, but it has recently expanded into supporting various types of documents in additional to software files in different languages. It is usually pre-installed on most Mac OSX systems, but Windows machines might have to manually install it. Git allows user to keep track of changes to files and folders, and often times between multiple authors or developers, within a repository. Developers can see all the histories of all the files in the repository as well as the description on each individial change. One advantage of Git over some other version control system is that it saves a copy of the entire repo on the user's machine, so user can work offline and save all changes without needing any network connection. Of course, if one wants other collaborators to receive the changes, one will need to connect to the internet and push the changes onto a git server.</p>
<p>The first step of using Git is obtain or create a repository. One can either clone an existing repo, or initialize a new one. In this project, I created my own Git repo by using the following commands:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">mkdir</span> stat159-project1
<span class="kw">cd</span> stat159-project1
<span class="kw">git</span> init</code></pre></div>
<p>One of the best practices is to creating a new branch whenever one is working on something new. Branching effectively copies the current state of the repository and isolates it into a different environment. Usually a repository will have a master branch which is the main branch which everything branches off from. It should have the last working copy of the files before any other developers starts to work on new features and tools. The reasoning behind the separation is so that one can easily roll back to the last working copy without having to scramble to see what changes have been made. All one has to do is delete the current branch he or she has been working on and create a new branch off the master. In this project I did not use any branch because I started from a blank repo, but if one is joining a large repo, it's definitely a must to start a new branch and not change master directly.</p>
<p>The next step is to make edits on files in the repo. Using one's favorite editor, edit the source code or text description and save the changes. Git will automatically tracks changes, such as new files or modified files. Then one can stage the changes by using the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">git</span> add filename1 filename2 [...]</code></pre></div>
<p>Then one can save all the changes into a commit with a commit message. Commit message should be short and descriptive of what the changes being saved are about. It's a good practice to commit often because they cost next to nothing. Because the commits are going to be part of the history log, which users can use to roll back to a previous state of the repository, it is better to roll back bit by bit rather than rolling back a large chunk of changes. In this project, One can commit staged changes using the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Descriptive message&quot;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The last step of version control is to update the git server with local changes. One will need to <em>push</em> all the local changes saved on local disk onto an online git server, where other collaborators could see the changes as well. Origin is usually the default remote name for the online repo, but the name could vary. The following commands allow user to push changes to the master branch (which should only be used after thorough testing) or create a new branch on the remote server using the current branch the user is working on:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">git</span> push origin master 
<span class="kw">//or</span>
<span class="kw">git</span> push origin branch</code></pre></div>
<p>Collaborators can get the newest changes by <em>pulling</em> from the remote repo:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">git</span> pull origin master</code></pre></div>
<p>Below are some useful commands of git:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>git help</strong>
<ul>
<li>help document</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>git config</strong>
<ul>

<h3 id="github">GitHub</h3>

<p>GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It extends git by providing all the git functionalities as well as adding different new collaboration features. One important feature GitHub provides is the ability to have private repos. Users have the ability to develop privately with others and not have the public know what they're working on. Although that defeats the purpose of having open-source and distributable research, it provides some necessary privacy when the project or research is confidential. GitHub is a very important tool because it brings git's command line interface onto the web, which is significantly more user friendly for non-tech savy individuals. Different collaborators can see changes and differences straight from the web with animations and color syntax. In this project, I used GitHub to clone the project specs and images from Professor's GitHub repo:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">git</span> clone https://github.com/ucb-stat159/stat159-fall-2016.git</code></pre></div>
<p>The cloned folder automatically is a git repo, with all the functionalities described above. The default name for the remote repo it's tracking is <em>origin</em>. If, in my case, I wanted to create a blank repo on GitHub and connect my local git repo to that, I can simply add the remote repo onto my current repo with the following commands and the remote repo will keep track on my local repo:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">git</span> remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame
<span class="kw">//edit</span> files
<span class="kw">git</span> add file1
<span class="kw">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&#39;initial commit&#39;</span>
<span class="kw">git</span> push origin master</code></pre></div>
<p>The whole point of version control system is to prevent unnecessary back-tracking and allow collaborators to efficiently and quickly store changes without breaking anybody else's code. Git combined with GitHub allow us to do just that by provided a distributed solution, keeping changes both locally and on the network, so everyone can be in-sync in an organized way. Remember to do changes in small bits and commit often to away disastrous roll-backs if something goes wrong.</p>
<h3 id="markdown">Markdown</h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/markdown-logo.png" />

</div>
<p>Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax designed to be converted to HTML, PDF, and other formats. It is widely used to create readme files and provide rich text in a plain text editor. In this project, all the documents are written in Markdown, including the README file. Markdown is extremely simple and fast, so writers can format a document with far less time that writing in other syntax. One major advantage of using Markdown is the portability of the file, as writer can exit the file in any text editor in any system. There is no need to compress and archive because the size of the file is the smallest you could get. Below are some of examples within the Markdown language:</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><h4 id="header">Header</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>##header</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>Italics</em>
<ul>
<li><code>*word*</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Bold</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>**word**</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>
<ul>
<li><code>[Google](http://www.google.com)</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>List
<ul>
<li><code>-, *, or +</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ordered List
<ul>
<li><code>1. Item</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bash">bash</h3>
<p>Bash is a Unix shell and command language that runs in a text window, where user types commands that causes action within the user's system. Users can save bash commands in a file, called script, so all commands can be run over and over without having to type them out, which is how some automations are done. Throughout this project, I had to use bash commands to connect to GitHub, initialize a new repo, save changes, and convert document types. It is an extremely useful tool to learn.</p>
<h3 id="pandoc">Pandoc</h3>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../images/pandoc-logo.png" />

</div>
<p>Pandoc is an open-source software document converter, having the ability to produce documents in a variety of formats from Markdown files. Writers can even incorporate statistical analysis written in R and processed with Knitr in the documents. Possible input document types include (but are not limited to) markdown, reStructuredText, textile, HTML, DocBook, LaTeX, MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, OPML, Emacs Org-Mode, Txt2Tags, Microsoft Word docx, LibreOffice ODT, EPUB, and Haddock markup. Possible output document types include (but are not limited to) HTML formats (HTML5, XHTML), Ebooks, XML, docx, OPML, LaTeX, Markdown, DokuWiki markup, DocBook, PDF, and InDesign ICML. Pandoc is a command-line tool, making it extremely easy to incorporate into automated scripts and systems. In this project, I used Pandoc to combine various Markdown files into a single Markdown file, and then converting that file to HTML output format. Below is an example on how to achieve that:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">//pandoc</span> -o OUTPUT INPUT
<span class="kw">pandoc</span> -o paper/paper.md paper/sections/*.md 
<span class="kw">pandoc</span> -o paper/paper.html paper/paper.md

<span class="kw">//To</span> PDF
<span class="kw">pandoc</span> -o paper/paper.pdf --latex-engine=xelatex paper/paper.md</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="makefile">Makefile</h3>
<p>Makefile is a file containing a set of directives used with the <em>make</em> build automation tool, usually directs <em>make</em> how to compile files and link the files into a program. For this project, Makefile is used mostly to automate a set of commands that I need to merge and convert the documents into a HTML output file. However in the industry, larger projects will benefit from Makefile significantly by reducing its build time because <em>make</em> keeps tracks of unchanged files and only recompile changed files. As you can probably tell, if a project takes hours to compile, a developer doesn't want to recompile the whole project just to see the effect of changing a few lines. In this project, I made a very simple Makefile to automate the process:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">mdfiles</span> = paper/sections/*.md

<span class="kw">all</span>: paper.html

<span class="kw">paper.html</span>: <span class="ot">$(</span><span class="kw">mdfiles</span><span class="ot">)</span>
    <span class="kw">pandoc</span> -o paper/paper.md <span class="ot">$(</span><span class="kw">mdfiles</span><span class="ot">)</span>
    <span class="kw">pandoc</span> -o paper/paper.html paper/paper.md

<span class="kw">clean</span>:
    <span class="kw">rm</span> paper/*.html</code></pre></div>
<p>I will now explain each line in my Makefile and show how one can use the same structure for automation.</p>
<p>First we can define variables that we can reference throughout the Makefile with <code>$()</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">mdfiles</span> = paper/sections/*.md
<span class="kw">//reference</span> by <span class="ot">$(</span><span class="kw">mdfiles</span><span class="ot">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>all</code> is a special word that specifies which targets to execute when <em>make</em> is called in the command line. In my case, I only want to create <code>paper.html</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">all</span>: paper.html</code></pre></div>
<p>Now let's talk about the targets and dependencies. The structure of a Makefile is pretty standard:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">target</span>: dependencies
        <span class="kw">commands</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In my example, the target file is paper.html, which is the file I am trying to create. The dependencies are a list of Markdown files that I stored into a variable, which are the files that I need in order to create the output file. My commands are pandoc commands to combine a list of Markdown files into a single Markdown file, and then converting that into an HTML file. We could combine the commands into one line by using <strong><em>;</em></strong> if one prefers. These commands tell the computer how I want to generate the output file using the dependencies I have.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">paper.html</span>: <span class="ot">$(</span><span class="kw">mdfiles</span><span class="ot">)</span>
    <span class="kw">pandoc</span> -o paper/paper.md <span class="ot">$(</span><span class="kw">mdfiles</span><span class="ot">)</span><span class="kw">;</span> <span class="kw">pandoc</span> -o paper/paper.html paper/paper.md</code></pre></div>
<p>Lastly, I want to add in a <em>phony</em> target <code>clean</code> to make sure my folders are cleaned and all unnecessary files are deleted before I generate a new version of the targets, and in this project, the HTML file is the only thing that needs to be removed:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="kw">clean</span>:
    <span class="kw">rm</span> paper/*.html</code></pre></div>
<p>As one can see, Makefile is not as daunting as it looks or sounds. Users just need to understand the structure of the Makefile and repeat it. It really makes automation a breeze.</p>
