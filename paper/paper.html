<p>This paper will go through many different types of computational tools that help make developing new software or research as well as collaborating much easier and more efficient. The tools that this paper will discuss are Git, GitHub, pandoc, Markdown, Make, and Vim text editor. It will dive into the pros and cons of using these different types of tools and how to use them to create a reproducible project. After reading, one can easily follow the same steps and achieve reproducible results, and hopefully maintain such practice in the long term for future development and research. Lastly, this paper will conlude with discussions on other software considerations as well as on reproducible computational research.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>One might ask, what is <em>reproducibility</em> and why is it important? Imagine a researcher has spent tens of hours to write a piece of computational tool that was vital to his or her research project. However, the researcher forgets to mark down the steps to obtain the final result. Not only does the researcher now have to restart from scratch and rewrite the whole process, but the researcher also has to remember the correct steps. Having reproducibility in one's research allows same or different researchers to replicate identical findings under the same environment, including computer systems, data input, and parameters. Having the ability to reproduce identical results allows other researchers to expand on the research in a collaborative manner. This paper will go through some tools that will help with collaborative and reproducible research:</p>
